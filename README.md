# JS-JSON-REST-API application is based on the REST API.

The application is implemented in JavaScript without using client JS frameworks.

To obtain a list of invoices, requests to the server based on the REST API are executed.
As the server for publishing the REST API, JSON Server is used.
The server is deployed on Heroku.

AJAX is used to complete server requests from an application.

## Deployed versions of the application on GitHub Pages:
